TODO list
=========
- Comparator should be configurable, so exposed during the construction of the DB
- Make Bloom filters, Snappy, and other paramenters such as LRU size, Log file size configurable
- Get rid of kvec library
- While traversing an iterator additions and deletions (> current value) should be inserted in a temporary object of the iterator so we can provide a consistent experience?
- Block sst_loaders during iterations?
